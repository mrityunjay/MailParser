I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\n\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \n\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski\'s.

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook c=\nlient will be configured on your computer.\nAfter migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve ma=\nil via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is c=\nonfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is m=\nigrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your=\n web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and T=\no-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook cl=\nient is configured on your desktop.\n\n2. Remote access to your mailbox.\nAfter your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OW=\nA) for remote access to your mailbox.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connect=\ning to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA availab=\nle from your home or when traveling abroad.\n\nHOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)\n\nLaunch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou=\n-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe\n\nSubstitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You=\n will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in \"corp/your us=\ner id\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.=\n  You will now be able to view your mailbox.\n\n=09\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality betwee=\nn the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the thin=\ngs in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of t=\nhe functions NOT available via OWA:\n\nFeatures NOT available using OWA:\n\n-  Tasks\n-  Journal\n-  Spell Checker\n-  Offline Use\n-  Printing Templates\n-  Reminders\n-  Timed Delivery\n-  Expiration\n-  Outlook Rules\n-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall\n-  Sharing Contacts with others\n-  Task Delegation\n-  Direct Resource Booking\n-  Personal Distribution Lists\n\nQUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?\n\nIf you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the =\nOutlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:\n\n=09Outlook.2000@enron.com\n\nOtherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:\n\n=09713-853-1411\n\nThank you,\n\nOutlook 2000 Migration Team', '[]', '', 'URGENT'),

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California\'s problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\'s a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

Any possibility for a=\n deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=\nans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=\nus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=\nans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=\nnce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double=\n dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=\nislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=\ne details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=\ne.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=\ng-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=\nhat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =\nbreach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=\ne bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=\nll be very difficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=\ne would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=\n Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =\n$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=\nl disclosure of the governor\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the =\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=\n will support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=\nll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=\nk of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=\nr community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=\nended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=\nntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\'s language states that the state should get =\npaid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=\nkely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20\n=20\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=\nans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =\nthe General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =\nof the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=\nicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=\n to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=\nrtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=\nications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n=20\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\nInitial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 B\nLenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B\n=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B\n=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M\nTax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\nProjected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77%\n=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%\nCurrent Projected=20\nBlended IR:=09=095.38%\nMaturity Date:=09=09August 29, 2001\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\n\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=\nhe California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=\n authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=\nhorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=\ntional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =\ngoing forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=\nations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =\nhas  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =\nthat must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=\nurther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =\nis clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=\ning power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=\nornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=\ndered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=\nier in the crisis.\n=20\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=\nhe first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=\ngust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=\no sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=\nigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=\ns and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=\nes that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=\nruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20\n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=\nsuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=\ntating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=\nen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=\nate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=\nassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=\n bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=\n the DWR proportionately from rate payments.', '', '', 'Informational'),

He tracks all the plant \nclosures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert\'s group but it seems on a \nmore comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track \nthis number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic \nconditions- like recession!!).  I will try to find out what his total number \nfor turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does \nnot seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for \nthe summer.\n\nWhile he\'s a seller above $6, he\'d also be a buyer of summer at lower levels\nHe firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) \nbased on his relationship with the producing community although I personally \nthink that 1Q02 sees little.  I know that the fundamentals group is tracking \nthese numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q \nover 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.\n\nHe really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, \ncrude/propane....\n\n+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 \nstorage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the \nbackwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower \nbaseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.  I am torn \non this one.\n\n+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same \nanalysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long \nnat gas!! through vol or outright.\n\n+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas \njust crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM \nissues- they like to look out in the calendar years. \n\n+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: \nMoore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance \n(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, \nI\'ll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.\n\nHave a great holiday!

Then it saw a better\ndeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting\nunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is\nselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it\npays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.\nIt is a measure of this winter\'s fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in\nenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even\noil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or\nnatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large\nindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --\nwill free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they\nalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum\nand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to\nconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.\n\"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don\'t know\nwhat they\'re going to use to grow crops with,\" said David Wyss, chief\neconomist at Standard & Poor\'s. Some economists have recently increased\ntheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter\'s heating bills on\nan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated\nthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a\ntypical U.S. household.\nThat and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher\nenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected\ngrowth in the nation\'s economic output by one percentage point on an annual\nrate in the first three months of next year. \"Overall, the recent energy\nprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic\nslowdown,\" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in\nSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use\nnatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the\ncompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in\nDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,\nwhich are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its\nexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative\nofficer.\n\"We looked at these [current] prices and said, \'This is crazy,\' \" he said.\nTerra hasn\'t disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but\nRosenbury said it would be \"substantial.\"  In coming months, Terra\'s good\nfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the\nprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even\npoint. That would keep Terra\'s plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate\nthe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. \"If this persists,\"\nRosenbury said, \"it\'s going to be a real problem.\"\nHe estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18\nmillion tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn\'t operating\nnow. \"Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It\'s possible that\nfarmers will not have as much as they want,\" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark\nInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and\ndistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,\nindefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next\nmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify\ncontinued production. \"We believe it\'s likely this is a speculative bubble\n[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we\'ll be able to\nbuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,\" said Paul\nM. Murphy, the company\'s managing director for financial planning. A\ncontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and\nraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers\' decisions to\nplant feed corn, he said. \"It\'s sticker shock.\"\nAccording to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas\nremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --\nfarm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the\naluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the\nindustry\'s No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O\'Carroll, an\nanalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.\nAluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,\nand December\'s production will be lower still, he said. \"We\'ll get more\nproduction cut announcements, I think,\" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and\nworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum\nsupplies. \"But if the world economy doesn\'t fall completely apart, then\n[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more\nthan the current forecast,\" he said. In Kaiser\'s case, it\'s an open question\nhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually\nentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,\nsays spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville\nfor $550 a megawatt hour for December.\nBut the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future\nprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,\nto invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to\nBonneville\'s other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and\nBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after\nnext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries\nto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. \"Out\nhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an\nethical dimension to this and we\'re not shy in trying to make sure they live\nup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,\" Mosey\nsaid.\n, 2000 The Washington Post Company', '[\"say\", \"price\", \"gas\", \"production\", \"natural\", \"plant\", \"year\", \"aluminum\", \"fertilizer\", \"electricity\"]', NULL, 'Informational'),

Perhaps \nsurprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and \ngasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. \nDistillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 \nkbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold \nweather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well \nabove last year\'s Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur \nmaterial, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. \nHowever, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.\nGasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not \nthe finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? \nStocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. \nImports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.\nAgain, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly \nhigh number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),

This quote covers consulting and maintenance.  They are trying \nvery hard to get a deal done this year  and we could probably get our \nadditional components at the current quote price if we signed.  \n\nBMC, Control -M\nApprox. 325 k   This is after we remove the SAP modules and components from \nthe quote. Quote that was sent over from Jeff Youngflesh (Enron GSS) was for \na total of 628 k\n\nHardware for either product is approx. 300 k. \n\nWe have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to take \nover their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our long \nterm strategy. They actually do not recommend either of these product\'s SAP \nmodules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectors \ninto BMC.  We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft \n(Larry if you have info on this please comment).\n\nLarry\'s and his team have eval\'d both products and although they are leaning \ntowards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable.  You \nguys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight it \nwill lend to the EBS/BMC deal.  FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45% \ndiscount if we cut the SAP modules.  BMC needs to sit down with PB and learn \nhow over priced their products are !\n\nLet me know what you think.  If we go TidalSoft I need to push this through \nor be advised to let it go till the New Year.\n\nThanks\nBruce\n\n\n*****\nAlso in Quote sent over from Youngflesh :\nBMC, Control SA\n1.3 M     NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME  - Is a candidate for future \nconsideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculate \nas to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS.

Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the \n11/16th meeting)\n\nMatt,\n \nOn November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron\'s \ntrading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit \ncenter on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, \nheld in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron\'s \nproducts and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron \n(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).\n\nOn November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark \noutlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and \nwireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:\n\n1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola \nhas stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this \ninformation and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short \nterm opportunity.  What is HP\'s time horizon for short term?\n\n2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to \nexplore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)\n\n3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT \nSourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   \n\nIn conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several \ndecisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:\n\n\nGerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More \nimportantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews \nof Enron\'s products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the \nGSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been \nunable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between \nCashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has \nremained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.\n\n\nClearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior \nlevel so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship \nforward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this \nstrategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But \nGerry\'s short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, \nrather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the \nrelationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and \nGreg Pyle.  Lovejoy\'s boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP\'s America\'s Central \nRegion.\n\n In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding \nwireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS \ninitiative by reiterating the following two points:  \n\n a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on \nthe process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only \nsome of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)\n\n b) HP\'s ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP\'s \nbusiness relationship process with Enron\n\n Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill \nDwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in \nthe near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer \nin person.  \n\n\nWe look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and \nother opportunities. \n\nSarah-Joy Hunter\nEnron Corporation\nGlobal Strategic Sourcing - Business Development\n#(713)-345-6541', '[\"term\", \"business\", \"relationship\", \"communication\", \"short\", \"date\", \"bill\", \"process\", \"meeting\", \"contact\"]', NULL, 'Informational'),

Sorry I had to leave but I had to\nmeet with Beth Pearlman. I believe there was a lot of good information\nexchanged and that is why we ran so late. I certainly came away with a\ndifferent insight to Enron that I did not have before we met.\n\nRegarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some\nthings are very clear in our go forward strategy.\n\nAt the end of the day, the account team (Dave Spurlin up through Jeff,\nmyself and Jerry) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship. If\ncorporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the\naccount. Peter Blackmore is very clear about that. He was always preserved\nthe integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer.\nThat is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are\ntaking place within Enron.  He isn\'t the decision maker on deals like the\nEBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other\nbusiness opportunities within Enron. Dave\'s sole responsibility is Enron and\nmaking sure that your needs are being met. He will direct and assist in\nmaking sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the\nrelationship with Enron. I need your help with all Enron organizations to\nmake sure that they use Dave as the focal point. If folks continue to go\naround him, situations like EBS will continue. He has to have the total\npicture of business transactions happening at Enron. He will understand how\nthose situations can impact the business at and for Enron.\n\nSecondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts\nwith Enron. Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the\nsixth year being optional. The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per\nyear. I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years.\nSo at 5 years the value is $80.5M. If you have something different, let\'s\nmake sure that we are on the same page. I have attached the emails that I\nreceived this data from.\n\n <<RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.>>  <<RE: Enron Building\nServices Novi MI.>>\n\nRegarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level\nset very quickly. Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive\nlight. Compaq will honor it\'s commitments but we need to make sure that\nEnron does the same. The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of\nexpectations relative to Compaq\'s revenue from EBS versus what actually got\nbooked. Our expectations were $96M a year  based on the forecast provided by\nEBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday).  I find it\nvery difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held\naccountable for our portion of the deal, when we don\'t have the revenue to\noff set it.  Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based\non expectations that were set. I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to\nsee how it was left.   I also need to get your perspective on the\ntransaction. Jennifer, if there is a business opportunity,  Compaq certainly\nwants to continue in pursuing that with Enron. Provided it\'s equitable for\nboth sides.   I realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get\nthrough it.\n\n\nJennifer, once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and\nhosting Compaq. I will contact you later today.\nThanks,\n\n\nBob Jordan\nRio Grande Area Director\nCompaq Computer Corporation\n\nTele #281-927-6350\nFax #281-514-7220\nBob.Jordan@Compaq.com\n\n\nMessage-ID: <C34EB66A4168D211984900805FBEF6A6069BDA22@EXCHOU-NAFD04>\nFrom: \"Earle, Jerry\" <Jerry.Earle@COMPAQ.com>\nTo: \"Fiore, Michael\" <Michael.Fiore@compaq.com>\nCc: \"Leach, Renee\" <Renee.Leach@COMPAQ.com>, \"Jordan, Bob\"  \n<Bob.Jordan@COMPAQ.com>, \"Spurlin, David\" <David.Spurlin@COMPAQ.com>,  \n\"Gooden, Jeff\" <Jeff.Gooden@COMPAQ.com>\nSubject: RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.\nDate: Tue, 19 Sep 2000 14:29:34 -0600\nSensitivity: Company-Confidential\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nX-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2652.78)\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n\nMichael and Renee,\n  This is great news.

Compaq recently chose to hire the\nfacility manager as a permanent Compaq employee.  Enron Building Services\nprovided Compaq with revised pricing to reflect the modified scope of work.\nThe pricing provided by Enron was 11.1% higher than the price received by\nPitney Bowes.  The Enron account team has been informed that their pricing\nis not competitive and they been given the opportunity to lower their price.\nThey have opted not to lower the price.  The recommendation of both Real\nEstate and Procurement is to award the business to Pitney Bowes.\n\n\n    Enron Building Services Current Cost:\n\n      Base cost for services was\n$190,198.00\n       Admin/Help Desk\n$44,787.00\n       Ship/Rec\n$35,521.00\n       Receptionist\n$38,610.00\n       Facilities Manager\n$71,280.00\n      Mail Van/Car (remote site\nsupport)   $13,030.00\n      Management Fee\n$14,210.00\n      Total Cost\n$216,438.00\n\n    Compaq hired the facility manager as a\nbadged employee.\n\n    Enron Building Services Proposed Cost:\n\n    Base cost for remaining services\n$128,071.00\n       Admin/Help Desk\n$53,940.00\n       Ship/Rec\n$35,521.00\n       Receptionist\n$38,610.00\n      Mail Van/Car (deleted)\n      Management Fee\n$8,324.00\n      Total Cost\n$136,395.00\n\n\n    Issue: 20% increase in Admin/Help desk\ncost.\n\n    Pitney Bowes has submitted a proposal to\nprovide Admin/Help Desk coverage, Shipper/Receiver, Receptionist for a total\ncost of. $121,248.00 which is 11.1% less than EBS proposal.\n\n\n\n    Regards,\n\n    Michael Fiore\n    General Procurement\n    Procurement Manager REOS & Telecom\n    Compaq Computer Corporation\n    PH:  (281) 514-1399\n    Fax:  (281) 514-0686\n    michael.fiore@compaq.com', '[]', NULL, 'Informational');

Per your \nrequest, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP\'s business \npartners was e-mailed to you this morning.\n\nHP contacts to date: \n\nBill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager\nHouston, TX\n#(713)-439-5587\n(Gerry Cashiola\'s boss)\n\nGerry Cashiola, sales representative \nHouston, TX\n#(713)-439-5555\n(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)\n\nGreg Pyle, Solution Control Manager\nSoutheast Region\nAustin, TX \n(#(512)-257-5735\n(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer \nleadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)\n\nDaniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances\nAustin, TX\n#(512)-257-5736\n(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)\n\nBill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions\nCupertino, CA\n#(408)-447-5240\n(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP\'s business \npropositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value \npropositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the \n11/16th meeting)\n\nMatt,\n \nOn November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron\'s \ntrading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit \ncenter on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, \nheld in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron\'s \nproducts and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron \n(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).\n\nOn November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark \noutlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and \nwireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:\n\n1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola \nhas stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this \ninformation and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short \nterm opportunity.  What is HP\'s time horizon for short term?\n\n2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to \nexplore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)\n\n3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT \nSourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   \n\nIn conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several \ndecisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:\n\n\nGerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More \nimportantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews \nof Enron\'s products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the \nGSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been \nunable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between \nCashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has \nremained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.\n\n\nClearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior \nlevel so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship \nforward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this \nstrategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But \nGerry\'s short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, \nrather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the \nrelationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and \nGreg Pyle.  Lovejoy\'s boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP\'s America\'s Central \nRegion.\n\n In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding \nwireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS \ninitiative by reiterating the following two points:  \n\n a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on \nthe process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only \nsome of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)\n\n b) HP\'s ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP\'s \nbusiness relationship process with Enron\n\n Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill \nDwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in \nthe near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer \nin person.  \n\n\nWe look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and \nother opportunities. \n\nSarah-Joy Hunter\nEnron Corporation\nGlobal Strategic Sourcing - Business Development\n#(713)-345-6541', '[\"communication\", \"term\", \"business\", \"relationship\", \"bill\", \"process\", \"meeting\", \"date\", \"wireless\", \"conversation\"]', NULL, 'Informational'),

Basically, the testing is not fully \ncompleted, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is \nalso a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the \npurchase decision).  As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out \non vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas.  \nHowever, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to \nsurmise that BMC is not in the driver\'s seat in either situation.\n\nIn a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC\'s revenue opportunity with \nthe Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at \nEBS.  The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema \nManager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, \nespecially given the time constraints imposed in your situation.  \n\nStill, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential \nvendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC \npurchase at this point.  I will be on vacation next week, but will be \nchecking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th.  Jennifer or I will keep \nyou posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor.\n\nI have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug\'s most recent communication to \nme.  The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net \nWorks teams in question:  more testing, but looks like BMC\'s total sales \nopportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your \ndeal done.

This is a follow up call to the calls from different Fedex \nbusiness units which I have received.\n\n(buy side--John Will)  I forwarded John\'s latest update earlier this week \nthen his note below.  First, he had several conference calls with George \nWasaff to John Pattillo.  John Pattillo had committed to getting back to John \non Friday (he didn\'t) with the specifics of ABS\' counter offer to FEDEX.  \nJohn\'s e-mail below notes that on Friday 12/15 by noon he heard nothing back \nfrom Pattillo.  Second, John is to hear back from Carmen Perez today, Fedex \naccount rep, on any news from Fedex lawyers and team regarding Fedex\'s \nresponse to lawsuit issue update.  Third, George Wasaff has made himself \navailable to fly to Memphis with John this week if necessary and if this will \nhelp resolve the lawsuit issue in our favor.  Fourth, John has been told to \nbegin to pull back business from FEDEX in terms of the GSS contractual \nrelationship.  I\'ve asked John to keep us in the loop on the developments \nwith these four items and what he finally decides to do 12/22 on the Fedex \naccount.\n\nHP:  Wireless conference call with Peter G. went fine.  Peter G. has asked \nDarrin to set up a follow up meeting with HP after 1/8/01 when the Enron \nwireless team returns from London.  This is in progress.  EFS/Datawarehouse \nequipment meeting set for early Jan.  Spoke with Peter G.\n\nI spoke with Bill Dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the \nopportunity to work more closely with Enron but would want to work in concert \nwith the sales force.  My e-mailed question to you was as follows:  Do we \njust wait to hear back from Greg Pyle given your phone call to him and Peter \nG. message delivered to him on 12/14?\n\n\nKinko\'s:  Connected Mike Rabon to Kinko\'s CIO via conference call.  That \nenables the EBS proposition to move forward with Kinko\'s.  Also, connected Ed \nQuinn and Chris Charbonneau to VP of purchasing.  He is the initial decision \nmaker.  Chris Charbonneau and I got on a follow up conference call with VP of \nPurchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from \nEIM Pulp & Paper team 9 months ago.  But, the offer was not as competitive as \nthe options offered by the Kinko\'s paper mills.  Ed and Chris have some \nhomework to do to improve the offer and get back to the VP of Purchasing.  \nOnce we get past this initial hurdle, I will work with Quinn and Charbonneau \non getting to the CFO\'s office as necessary.  So, both sides are moving \nfoward here.\n\nAlso, had Ed Quinn meet with Craig Brown and Tracy F.  on office automation \n(pulled Jeff Youngflesh up to speed as well) since he couldn\'t attend the \nmeeting.  Ed had some great ideas for the process.\n\n\nContinental:  Wasaff will speak briefly with Ron Howard on Wednesday at 1:30 \nPM as a follow up thank-you.  Meeting minutes sent out.

Everett, I am asking for your input as \nit is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the \nrelationship owners.  During the meeting yesterday - the following happened :\n a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately \n(his replacement has yet to be named).  My perception is that Keith took the \nhit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales \nprojections.   EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected \ntargets.  \n b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his \nexisting Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server \nAgreement \n c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS \nServices.   For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed \nat $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an \n8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters.  EBS sent \nCompaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th.   Compaq has not paid the \ninvoice.  Lou Casari\'s team is handling the delinquency and notifying \nCompaq.  Compaq ( Keith M.\'s stewardship) had agreed to pay.  Bob stated that \nEBS has not performed to Compaq\'s satisfaction under the Server Agreement and \nCompaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS \nservices (Bob\'s first negotiation position).   \n d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in \nthe EBS Server Spend amount.    \n  Compaq (Bob Jordan) value  - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and \nhardware in 2000\n  EBS (added)    - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million \nfor servers and hardware in 2000\n  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in \n1999\n  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional \nservices (costs for Server deployment)\n\n From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the \nfollowing might occur\n  EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000  at 8% would equal a Compaq \npurchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)\n  Compaq total is $5.1 million spend  at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase \namount of $408,000\n  EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount \nis $4,134,229. (I did not concede) \n\n e) 2000 income.   Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had \nto pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could \ndefer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, \n2002.  If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the \nright to spend against the amount.  To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS \nworked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS \nconsulting services provided to Compaq.   Again, under Keith M\'s stewardship \n- they verbally agreed to pay. \n\nNow with the above information - my offered next steps :\n a) Until everything is done - maintain the \"stick\" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 \nmillion).  This is being done.\n b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee.   It \ndoes state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages.  Prior \nconversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee \n(again with Keith M).   This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. \n c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on \nservices of $4.1 million.   This is a good return for a commodity \ntransaction.  So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier \nrelationship.   \n\n So...... please let me know your thougths.   We have countered with the $2.5 \nmillion with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000.  \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts\n\nKim Godfrey\nDirector, Enterprise Services\nEnron Broadband Services\nphone : 713 345 8813\ncell :      713 501 8105\nfax:        713 853 7354', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),

EBS has identified potential server business opportunities \n(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.  \nAfter our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin \nas the point person for these communications.

Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending \nadditional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business \nopportunities and issues.  \n\nEBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop \nthe streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th \nmeeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product \nand Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media \nsolutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the \nintent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these \nsolutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the \nappropriate next steps to further our relationship.  \n\nThe January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework \nfor our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until \nthose changes are made:\n1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq \nwas invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November \n7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice \namount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 \non or before December 31,2000.   \n2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, \nCompaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   \nThe understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written \nnotice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a \nnew contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  \nEBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if \nCompaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we \nlook forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.  \n\nAgain, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create \nstrategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.   \n\nKim Godfrey\nDirector, Enterprise Services\nEnron Broadband Services\nphone : 713 345 8813\ncell :      713 501 8105\nfax:        713 853 7354', '[\"agreement\", \"service\", \"look\", \"forward\", \"meeting\", \"relationship\", \"server\", \"supply\", \"product\", \"stream\"]', NULL, 'Informational'),

In the past, EBS had included David on \nthe direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction \nwas to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   \n\nIn regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to \nfill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in \nAugust 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and \nidentified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at \nleast 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both \nEBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq \nMinimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between \nboth Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time \nwas spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq \n(Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 \nsections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for \ncomments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  \nDuring the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain \npoints of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed \nto work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS \nconcessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate \nthe Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the \ndevelopment of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   \n\nEBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with \nour relationship.\n\nKim Godfrey\nDirector, Enterprise Services\nEnron Broadband Services\nphone : 713 345 8813\ncell :      713 501 8105\nfax:        713 853 7354\n\n\n\n	Jeff.Gooden@compaq.com\n	12/18/00 07:58 PM\n		 \n		 To: Kim Godfrey/Enron Communications@Enron Communications\n		 cc: \n		 Subject: RE: Compaq / EBS Relationship \n\nKim,\n\nThank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, Dave\nSpurlin \"Owns\" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq\'s perspective.\nAll matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your life\neasier.\n\nAlthough I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; My\nreaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enron\nand Compaq.

EBS has identified potential server business opportunities\n(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.\nAfter\nour meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the\npoint person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaq\nto\ndirect our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or\nKent\nMajor.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time\nwith\nDavid to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and\nissues.\n\nEBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop\nthe\nstreaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting\nthat\nthere are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server\nSupply\nAgreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS and\nCompaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product\nand\nServer Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS has\nhad\ninternal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our\nrelationship.\n\nThe January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework\nfor\nour relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until those\nchanges are made:\n1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq\nwas\ninvoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,\n2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice\namount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section\n3.0 on\nor before December 31,2000.\n2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,\nCompaq\n(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   The\nunderstanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice\nand\npayment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a new\ncontractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBS\nstrongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq\nbelieves that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look\nforward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.\n\nAgain, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create\nstrategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.\n\nKim Godfrey\nDirector, Enterprise Services\nEnron Broadband Services\nphone : 713 345 8813\ncell :      713 501 8105\nfax:        713 853 7354', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),

Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific \npreference?\n\nMeeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:\n\nRon Howard, Vice President, Food Services\nLarry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer\nGreg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company\nJeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)\n\nMr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, \nwe have coordinated through John Nowlan.  At the October 25th meeting,  Alan \nEngberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather \nderivatives opportunities, respectively.  \n\nNext week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines  Enron\'s \ncurrent relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed \ninitiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging.  Larry \nGagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing \ninput on this.\n\nSarah-Joy Hunter\nEnron Corporation\nGlobal Strategic Sourcing -- Business Development\n#(713)-345-6541', '[\"meeting\", \"continental\", \"fuel\", \"management\", \"plastic\", \"october\", \"president\", \"weather\", \"vice\", \"hedge\"]', NULL, 'Informational'),

It builds on \nOffset to Last Trade functionality.\n\nThe simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and \nBias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. \nAs Bias increases, the Offset increases.\n\nI\'ll call later to see what you think of the idea.\n\nDave\n\n \n\nProgram Criteria\n\nThe formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to \nwork with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:\n\nIntensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless \nof whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last \n[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction \nTibco messages for the Product.\nObviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction \nflow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.\nIntensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving \naverage Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].\n#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.\n#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.\nTransaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}\nBuy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.\nSell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.\nOffset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be \nreduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy \noccurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the \nORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.\nTransaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be \nreduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy \noccurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the \nTRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal \nto 1.\nSpread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this \nmight be [0.04]\nSpread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this \nmight be [0.50]\nOffset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A \npossible value for this might be [0].\nOffset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A \npossible value for this might be [0.50]\nInitial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started\nInitial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started\nSpread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed \nOffset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A \npossible value for this might be [0.01]\nDead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will \nrecalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during \nthe Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.\n\nProgram Outputs\n\nThe program should output the following variables as a result of combining \nthe above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:\n\nSpread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager\nOffset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager\nSuspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. \nNormally \"False\"\n\n\nProgram Interface and Operation Principles\n\nThe user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a \nrelationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the \nOutputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with \nIntensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. \n\nEvery time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will \nbe recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the \nprogram. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, \nthen Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and \nBuy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. \n\nIf the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread \nshould occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) \nor if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the \nsystem shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last \ntransaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread \nvalue.\n\nAny adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a \nreduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the \nBuy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced \naccordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula \nto a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain \nthe Spread-Offset Minimum.\n\nGUI/Formulas Example:\n\nConstants\nIntensity Factor: [4]\nDead Interval: [240]\nOffset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]\nTransaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]\nSpread Minimum [0.04]\nSpread Maximum [0.50]\nOffset Minimum [0]\nOffset Maximum [0.49]\nSpread-Offset Minimum [0.01]\n\n         INPUTS           OUTPUTS\nIntensity Formula\nFormula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension\nS1  >220   -0.01 n/a F\nS2  <30   +0.01 n/a F\nS3  <10   +0.02 n/a F\n\nTransaction Formula\nFormula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension\nV1  <4   n/a -0.01 F\nV2  >3   n/a +0.01 F\nV3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F\nV4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F\nV5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F\nV6  >20   n/a n/a T\n    \nNote that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also \nthat #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather \nare a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently \noccured.\n\nIn this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through \nthe GUI.\n\n\nSimulation\n\nObviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations \nto prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of \nhow the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular \ndirection, please see the attached:\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Features\n\nSystem Notifications\n\nThere should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be \nsimilar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both \nOffset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The \nFailure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be \nautomatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the \ntrader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both \nmaximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The \nnotification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). \nOffset checks will only be against a maximum value.\n\n\n\n\nDave', '[\"offset\", \"buy\", \"sell\", \"spread\", \"transaction\", \"value\", \"intensity\", \"minimum\", \"formula\", \"possible\"]', NULL, 'Informational'),

Bottom Line, expressed by \nNet Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC \nsoftware product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.\n\nYou related Jim Crowder\'s suggestion related to the use of indemnification \nand liquidated damages clauses being implemented.  Jennifer and I discussed \nthis situation, and our meetings with your team, in context.  We have a \npossible alternative for you to consider:  perhaps EBS might provide a hedge \nfor Net Works in the form of \"advance purchase\" of BMC product.\n\nFor example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but \nneeds to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total \nEnron purchases from BMC.  A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark \nwith BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC \ntime to \"click\" might be this:  EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC \nsoftware, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other \n$2 million is used as a \"future purchases\" fund, in which EBS buys, but does \nnot take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current \nsoftware...\n\nTHEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of \nBMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is \ndelivered from/by BMC.  That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other \nbusiness units aren\'t spending any of today\'s dollars for product which they \nseem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product \nwhen they need it in the future).  In addition, you secure the business with \nBMC right now.  I\'m sure you could also figure out how to account for the \ntime value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to \nyou.\n\nIf all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the \nmeantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on \nprogress.\n\nThanks,\n\nJeff\n\nJeff Youngflesh\nDirector, Business Development\nGlobal Strategic Sourcing\nEnron Corp.\n333 Clay Street, 11th Floor\nHouston, TX 77002\nt:  713-345-5968\nf:  713-646-2450\nc:  713-410-6716', '[\"net\", \"work\", \"million\", \"product\", \"software\", \"purchase\", \"concern\", \"business\", \"buy\", \"issue\"]', NULL, 'Informational'),

Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas \n(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has \none at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. \nApparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are \nabout 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic \nfeet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said \nyesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the \npipeline system in California. \n\nThis information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG \nconsultant. He said that he\'d had some similar calls about LNG, and also that \nhe\'d be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested \nin looking further into transporting LNG into California. \n\nAssuming that we could get a few \"portable pipelines\" and some trucks, there \nare five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:\n\nLocation Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage \n(gal) Storage (mmcf)\nTopock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2\nLaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2\nSacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8\nLaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92      \nEvanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2\n\nTotals         26.48\n\nWhether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question.

There are a \ncouple of reasons for this. \n\nFirst, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only \ntwo plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, \naffluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military \nand industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG \nTechnologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck \nfleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn\'t be a surprise that I \nwas not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT\'s fleet is \noperating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and \nTopock, Arizona - it\'s serving its normal fleet customers in Southern \nCalifornia and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by \nALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and \nsubsequent loading onto trucks.\n\nSecond, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The \naverage truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into \n820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could \ndeliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don\'t regasify LNG, they merely \ntransfer it into storage. \n\nThe only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would \nbe a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it\'s under \nrepair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 \nmmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a \ntime - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, \nALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some \nreason. \n\nI\'m going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. \nI think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located \npeakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. \n\nPlease let me know if you have specific questions.', '[\"truck\", \"plant\", \"fleet\", \"gas\", \"small\", \"unit\", \"pipeline\", \"deli\", \"foot\", \"cubic\"]', NULL, 'Informational'),

I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\n\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \n\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski\'s.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\'s share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \'fiscals\' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor\'s input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

(439, 'Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls372753', 'Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls', 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'pallen70@hotmail.com', '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000 \n04:35 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> \nSubject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls\n\n\nEnclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin\nthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.

Sitting at the confluence of several \nfiber optic backbones, the\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \neventually\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \n\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \ncenters near Seattle.\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \nGlobix and\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \nthe networking\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \n\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \neverything from your\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \nyour favorite Web sites.\n\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \nserver farms, are\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \nValley that some\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \nPuget Sound\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \nhigh-security\n                  facilities. \n\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \nare requesting 445\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \nsaid Karl\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \nEnergy. \"That is\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \n\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \nthe rise of the Internet\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \nheads. \n\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \nUtilities and\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \ndata centers. The\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company\'s existing \nresidential and business\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \nnecessary to support\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \nmillion each,\n                  Karzmar said. \n\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \nbring up the data center\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \n\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \nbusinesses and schools in the\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \n\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \nappetite for power --\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \nfacilities run 24 hours a\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \nconstant revenue\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \nthey could\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \nexpenditures. \n\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \nmean for power rates\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \n\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \nCity Light. \n\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \nlights at the football\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \nWe have data\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \nand 50 megawatts.\" \n\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \ncomplex in Tukwila is\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \nthe 1.35 million\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \nBoeing Space &\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \n92 percent of the\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \ncompanies. \n\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \nCommunications,\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \nNetworks all\n                  lease space in the office park. \n\n                       After building Exodus\' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \nSabey has become an\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \nmanagement or\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \nclaims his firm is\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \nthe country. \n\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \nbandwidth-heavy tasks\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \nco-location space in\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \n\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \nspace is growing at a\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \ncausing similar\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \nCalifornia. \n\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \nspace, plans to nearly\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \nWhile companies\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \nhigh-tech companies\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \nas Exodus that\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \nmanagement. \n\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \nconstruction and we plan to\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \ndemand right now\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \nexecutive at Exodus in\n                  Seattle. \n\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \nin the local utility\n                  industry perplexed. \n\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \nto serve the growth,\"\n                  said Seattle City Light\'s Royer. \"The utility industry is \nalmost stunned by this, in\n                  a way.\"', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),

 If you haven\'t taken the time to update your GIS \ninformation, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed \nas soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days \nago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to \ncall Ted Bland @ 3-5275.\n\nWith Enron\'s rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees \nbetween operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to \nhave one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee \ndata.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the \nyear-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC \nrequests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their \nprofiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education \nneed to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is \naccessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to \nhrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com \non the command line of your browser.\n\nThe target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would \nlike to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned \nfor input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please \ncontact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  \n\nYour  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   \n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),

The \nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\'t schedule their \ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \nthe generation side.\n\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \nthey don\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\n\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \nothers up here once you have it finished.  I\'d like to see how much gas \ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \nespecially compared to all gas consumption.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \nan issue, but I\'ll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \nO.K. as is, so I\'ll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \nI\'ll take care of it..\n\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \n$235,019.   \n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \n#\'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \nGDP-Kingsgate.\n\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \nI\'m not sure of the best way to handle this since we don\'t really have a \nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here\'s the \ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \nan operational reason why this occurred that I\'m not aware of, and the dollar \nimpact is very small, but I thought I\'d bring it to your attention just in \ncase there\'s something you want to do about it.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California\'s problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\'s a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.

Any possibility for a \ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \ndifficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \ndisclosure of the governor\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the \ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\'s language states that the state should \nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \n \nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n \nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\nCurrent Projected \nBlended IR:  5.38%\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\n\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \nidea  earlier in the crisis.\n \nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.', '[]', NULL, 'Informational');

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook \nclient will be configured on your computer.\nAfter migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail \nvia Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is \nconfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is \nmigrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your \nweb browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and \nTo-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook \nclient is configured on your desktop.\n\n2. Remote access to your mailbox.\nAfter your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) \nfor remote access to your mailbox.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while \nconnecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA \navailable from your home or when traveling abroad.\n\nHOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)\n\nLaunch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  \nhttp://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe\n\nSubstitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You \nwill be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in \"corp/your user \nid\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You \nwill now be able to view your mailbox.\n\n \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between \nthe Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things \nin OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the \nfunctions NOT available via OWA:\n\nFeatures NOT available using OWA:\n\n-  Tasks\n-  Journal\n-  Spell Checker\n-  Offline Use\n-  Printing Templates\n-  Reminders\n-  Timed Delivery\n-  Expiration\n-  Outlook Rules\n-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall\n-  Sharing Contacts with others\n-  Task Delegation\n-  Direct Resource Booking\n-  Personal Distribution Lists\n\nQUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?\n\nIf you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the \nOutlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:\n\n Outlook.2000@enron.com\n\nOtherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:\n\n 713-853-1411\n\nThank you,\n\nOutlook 2000 Migration Team', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that \nthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large \npart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which \nthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman \nbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \nanswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \nsome enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \ndemand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \nexport California\'s problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\'s a pretty \nstrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner \nout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and \nif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the \nagenda.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \ncompared with the previous year.\n\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\'s \neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\n\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \nquestions or need any further information.', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \nemployee cost of $94.00.\n\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \nas spaces become available. \n\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \n\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \ngarage.\n\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \n\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\nproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\non the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\nBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\nacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \n500+\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \nthis,\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\neffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\nloan amount to $8,868,000.\n\nI have summarized our issues as follows:\n\n1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\n\n     Pro-Forma                           Bank\'s Adjustment\n     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\n     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\n     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\n\n2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\nturn over.\n\n3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\n\n4.  Based on the Bank\'s revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\ndebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \ndebt\ncoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\n\n5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\n\n6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide\nequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:\n\n     Land -                   $1,121,670\n     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000\n     Cash Equity              $1,419,268\n     Total                    $2,955,938\n\n7.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \nrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \ncost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \nrepairs.\n\n2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \nmanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \ninterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \nthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a \nmanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \nonsite.\n\n3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you \nwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\n\n4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure \nthis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\n\nMy job just doesn\'t give me the time to manage this property.

Cash Needs\nHighlights:\nSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=\nplete=20\ncash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20\nprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=\ns=20\nand other measures.=20\nBased on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20\navailable cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=\n.8=20\nmillion to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20\nconservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\nII. Credit Relationships\nHighlights:\nSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20\nextend or renew credit as it has become due.\nAt present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\nSCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=\nlt.=20\nGenerally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=\nnd=20\npayable.\nSCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=\n=20\nindebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20\nindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\nCredit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =\nits=20\nrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=\n=20\nissues within the last three weeks.\nIII. Energy Cost Scenarios\nHighlights\nThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20\nvarious price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=\n such=20\nscenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\nIV. Cost Containment Initiatives\nHighlights\nSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\nThe Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=\n=20\nimprovement component as follows (in millions):\nOperating and maintenance costs     $ 77\nCapital Improvement Costs                383\nTotal                                             $ 460\nThe Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=\n=20\nbe eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=\nom=20\ncontract employees.\nUnder the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=\n=20\nmost part being deferred to a future date.\nSCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20\nexecutive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20\nsavings of approximately $92 million.\nV. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20\nActivity)\nHighlights:\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20\nTransition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20\nincludes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20\nmillion and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=\n=20\nTransition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\nNormally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=\ne=20\nend of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=\n=20\nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20\nD.01-01-018.\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20\ngeneration are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20\ntracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20\nexpressed in the TRA, are overstated.\nTURN Proposal\nAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=\nRN=20\nto change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=\ns.=20\nOur comments are summarized as follows:\nThe Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=\nt=20\nwould not directly generate nor use cash.\nThe Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=\nift=20\ncosts between two regulatory assets.\nTURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=\n the=20\nrevenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =\nin=20\nthe TRA is overstated.\nVI. Flow of Funds Analysis\nHighlights:\nIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=\n=20\npositive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\nDuring the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=\n=20\nits parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\nEdison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=\n=20\nshareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=\non=20\nstock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=\nve=20\nand general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\n[there is no Section VII]\n=20\nVIII. Earnings of California Affiliates\nSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=\n=20\nmillion annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20\nIn 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=\n=20\nThis increase correlates to the increase in market prices\nfor natural gas for the same period.\nA copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20\nwww.cpuc.ca.gov.\n=20\nDan', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\nBut that still wasn\'t enough juice.\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\n$250/MWh price cap.\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\nPowerex officials wouldn\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\nWednesday, but wouldn\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\nwhen the ISO\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\nDorinson said.\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\nthe high-priced power.\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said. It\'s still unclear whether retail\ncustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity\nrates or if companies will absorb the costs.\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay\nPwr Plant\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent\nSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy\nCorp.\'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,\nWednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.\nThe ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state\nsince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the\nreasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nAbout 11,000 MW of power has been off the state\'s power grid since Monday,\n7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the\nISO.\nThe ISO manages grid reliability.\nAs previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert\nat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would\ndip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid\ncollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn\'t result in rolling\nblackouts.\nThe ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),\nReliant Energy Inc.

(AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said\nWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by\nsome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate\nreasons.\nThe California Independent System Operator, which manages the state\'s power\ngrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public\nUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power\nplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,\nISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nThe state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for\nunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency\nfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and\ncustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be\ncalled on to do so.\nAs reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)\nsaid they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday\nevening.\nRepresentatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES\nand Dynegy Tuesday evening.\nAES told the visitors they couldn\'t perform an unannounced full inspection\nof the company\'s 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday\nmorning, when the plant\'s full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron\nThomas said.\nThomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn\'t know whether the representatives\nreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.\n\n   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits\n\nThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have\nused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down\ntwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality\nManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,\nThomas said.\nAES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire\nHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\nand Redondo Beach plants.\nThe ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\nhas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\ncompany $20 million for polluting.\n\"We\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\'t get sued for it,\"\nThomas said. \"It\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\ndistrict\'s\" authority.\nAs reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\ncould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\nline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\n\n   Dynegy\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\n\nDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday\nevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line\nWednesday.\n\"I guess our position is, \'Gee, we\'re sorry you don\'t believe us, but if you\nneed to come and take a look for yourself, that\'s fine,\'\" said Dynegy\nspokesman Lynn Lednicky.\nLednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and\nthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could\npose a safety hazard if not repaired.\n\"We\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We\neven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"\nLednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy\'s explanation of\nwhy its units were off line.\n-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n\n\nG_nther A.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn\'t benefit from \nhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.\n\n 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase \n1 complete in November)\n      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule\n      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule\n\nThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but \ncould be as favorable as 55/45.

The money would come from changing the basis for the \nQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December \n(and maybe earlier).\n\nPG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the \nForce Majeure notices off the table.

(902, '282675', '', 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'mike.grigsby@enron.com', 'By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star\nDate: 01/20/01 22:15\n\nAs natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile \nExchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas \nstorage number. \n\nThe storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the \nforecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\n\"Traders do that all the time; they\'re looking forward,\" said William Burson, \na trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" \n\nBut the market\'s response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation\'s director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\n\"It\'s a little frustrating that they don\'t take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting,\" McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \nand culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \nfingers at Wall Street. \n\nStephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \nstepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\'s speculators for \nthe rise in gas prices. \n\n\"It\'s my firm belief ... that today\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik \ntold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \n\nIn California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \nutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \n\nCloser to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \nfor this winter\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \ncustomers and constituents from such price spikes. \n\nMost utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \nprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \ninsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \nprices before they soared. \n\n\"We\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul \nSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \n\nBut critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \n\n\"There\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \nchange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \nAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \n\n\nHot topic \n\nConsumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \nmany circles, little else is discussed. \n\nThe Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \nfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \nprevious December\'s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \nwell. \n\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n\n\"It\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n\nA year ago that wasn\'t a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \nthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\'t make it worthwhile \nto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \ncustomers. \n\nBut trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \ncubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \nfor winter. \n\nThere was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \nprices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \nAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \nbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n\nBut $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \nincluding the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \nmarkets. \n\n\"It\'s all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n\nWholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \ntraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \ncommodity in the world. \n\n\nSetting the price \n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \ngas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \ncontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \nwidespread influence over gas prices. \n\nThe futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \nas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \nprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \nutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \nthey pay for the gas they expect to use. \n\nThere are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \nof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \nof natural gas. \n\nBut if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\'t need to \nknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\'re trading. Like all \nfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \ntheir volatility and to the traders\' ability to make or lose a lot of money \nin a short time. \n\nAs December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \nthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \nMuch of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association\'s \nweekly storage numbers. \n\nUtilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \nneed in the winter. \n\nGoing into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \naverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \nhopes that the summer\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \n\nStill, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \nsufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \nconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n\nThen the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \nnumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \nassociation\'s McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n\nBut some utility executives didn\'t share that view. William Eliason, vice \npresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December\'s cold snap had \ncontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n\n\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \n\nThen suddenly the market turned when January\'s weather turned warmer. \nWednesday\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \ndropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n\n\nJust passing through \n\nSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \npass their fuel costs on to customers. \n\nAmong area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers\' cost-of-gas \ncharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \nEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n\nSheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \nmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \nbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \nenergy. \n\nKansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \nsave an average customer about $25 this winter. \n\nMissouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \nextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \nguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n\nNow utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \ncustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \nthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \ncosts. \n\nOn Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \nCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \nperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy\'s gas purchasing practices. \n\n\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It\'s time to consider \nsome changes.\" \n\n\nTo reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \nseverly@kcstar.com. \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nAll content , 2001 The Kansas City Star', '[\"gas\", \"price\", \"utility\", \"say\", \"storage\", \"natural\", \"energy\", \"bill\", \"customer\", \"thousand\"]', NULL, 'Informational'),

At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.

In attendance were Ken Lay, \nthe Governor, the Governor\'s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \nproposals, the governor\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \nbased on the governor\'s comments:\n\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \nthe problem by \'02 and provide some political cover.\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \nwas a frequently recurring theme.\nUtilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \nbasis to consumers.\nMunicipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \nCalifornia.\nState universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \nwidely deploy distributed generation.\nExpand in-state gas production.\nTake state lands gas royalties in kind.\nnegotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \naddtional gas supplies.\nEmpower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \nmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \nany one time.\nCondition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\nEither eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \nmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder\'s group should be \nable to help out here).\nWants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \nsome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \nsome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \nthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \napproach with generators.\nSecuritize uncollected power purchase costs.\nTo dos: (Jeff, again I\'d like to prevail on you to assemble the group\'s \nthoughts and get them to Kari)\nHe wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \nnot just the 5 one year strips.\nHe wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\nHe would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \ndeal.\nHe wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the \nforward contracting issues.\nThanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.', '[]', NULL, 'Informational'),
